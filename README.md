# Twitch Notify

[![Build](https://github.com/pwnyprod/TwitchNotify/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pwnyprod/TwitchNotify/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Simple utility that sits in system tray, monitors Twitch users and
notifies with Windows 10 toast notifications when they go live.

To add/change monitored Twitch users edit the `TwitchNotify.ini` file next
to `TwitchNotify.exe` executable. Put users inside `[users]` section each
on separate line. You don't need to restart application after editing file,
it will be automatically reloaded on change.

Alternative option is to download followed user list from Twitch account. Set
your Twitch username in `.ini` file. And either set `autoupdate` to 1 to
download followed list automatically on startup, or explicitly choose
`Download` option in popup menu. Downloading followed user list will overwrite
`[users]` section in `.ini` file.

Windows 10 notification toast allows to open Twitch user locally in [mpv][]
media player, or Twitch page in browser. You can access all monitored users
with right click on icon, it will show checkbox next to users that are
currently live.

To use [mpv][] player locally you need to have `mpv.exe` and either [yt-dlp.exe][]
(recommended) or [youtube-dl.exe][] executables available in PATH.
